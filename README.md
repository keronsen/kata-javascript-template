# kata-javascript-template

Template for doing TDD katas with JavaScript. Uses [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) for testing.

## Instructions

1. Fork the repo
2. Open /test/jasmine.html in a browser to run the tests (1 passing, 1 failing)
3. Open /test/example_test.js to read the tests
4. Open /src/example.js and fix the code to make the test pass
5. Refresh /test/jasmine.html in the browser to run the tests again (2 passing)

## Adding your own code and tests

When adding files you must also update /test/jasmine.html with `<script>` tags to include them when running tests. Look for `example.js` and `example_test.js` to se how they are included.
